Month-long screenings of horror films during the month of October. 

October 2020: You can find the list of horror films I'm watching [here on github](https://github.com/baricks/shocktober/blob/master/shocktober-2020/viewing-schedule.md) and [here on Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/baricks/list/shocktober-2020/). I'm documenting my journey through these films in a [film blog](https://github.com/baricks/shocktober/blob/master/shocktober-2020/film-blog.md) that is being updating sporadically.
